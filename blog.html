                <p>"A bigger surprise, from the other end of the spectrum, is that Cyberpunk 2077 is up for two awards: Best Score and Music, and Best Role Playing.<br>
                     I can understand the nomination in the music category, but a best-of nomination in a gameplay-related category is remarkable. <br>
                     Cyberpunk 2077 was in a better state on PC than it was on console when it launched, but that's not saying much."</p>

                <p>The CB1100R is regarded as Honda’s first homologation special and it was raced successfully in production classes around the world <br>
                    including here in Australia, in New Zealand, in Europe and in South Africa. <br>
                    Locally, the CB1100R was made famous when it took out the 1982 Castrol Six Hour in the hands of Wayne Gardener and his teammate Wayne Clark. <br>
                    A year earlier, Malcolm Campbell and Mick Cole took the New Zealand Six Hour win on a CB1100R.</p>

                    a factory-approved Ford Ranger Raptor V8 dual-cab ute. Little did we know HSV was actually going down a similar path at <br>
                    the time with a Holden Colorado-based SportsCat V8. In fact, it was mere months away from being released.</p>
